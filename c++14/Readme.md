### C++14

- **return_type_deduction:** Automatically deduce their return type based on the return statement, simplifying code and enhancing flexibility.
- **decltype(auto):** Allows for flexible type deduction, preserving references and cv-qualifiers when deducing the return type.
- **relaxed_constexpr_restrictions:** Allow more functions and expressions to be evaluated at compile-time.
- **variable_templates:** Allow the creation of templated variables, enabling specialization for different types.
- **aggregate_member_initialization:** Allows direct initialization of aggregate members within an initializer list.
- **binary_literal:** 0b prefix to represent binary numbers directly in code.
- **digit_separator:** Using single quotes (') to enhance the readability of large numeric literals.
- **generic_lambdas:** Allowing the use of auto for lambda parameter types, enabling type deduction within lambdas.
- **lambda_caputure_initializers:** Allowing you to initialize captured variables directly within the lambda expression.
- **deprecated_attribute:** Mark functions, classes, or other entities as deprecated, warning users when they are used.
- **make_unique:** Utility function that creates a std::unique_ptr in a safe, efficient, and concise manner.
- **exchange:** Atomically replaces the value of a variable with a new one and returns the old value.
- **user_defined_literals:** Allow creating custom literals for standard library types, enabling more intuitive and readable code.
- **shared_time_mutex and shared_lock:** std::shared_timed_mutex allows multiple threads to share ownership of a resource with timed locking, while std::shared_lock provides a way to manage shared ownership efficiently.
- **heterogeneous_lookup:** Allows associative containers to search for keys using types other than the container's key type, improving performance and flexibility.
