### C++20

- **concepts:** Allow you to define constraints on template parameters for improved type safety and clearer error messages.
- **coroutines:** Enable asynchronous programming and state machines by allowing functions to suspend execution and later resume from where they left off.
- **modules:** Allow you to organize code into modular units, improving compilation times and managing dependencies more effectively. (Work in Progress)
