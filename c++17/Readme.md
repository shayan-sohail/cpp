### C++17

- **structured_bindings:** Allow unpacking tuples, structs, and arrays into individual named variables for better readability and convenience.
- **inline_variables:** Allow variables to be declared inline, enabling them to be defined in headers and used as constant expressions across translation units.
- **if_constexpr:** Allows conditional compilation based on compile-time constant expressions, enabling more flexible and optimized code paths.
- **if_and_switch_initializer:** Allow variable initialization directly within the conditional statement.
- **fold_expressions:** Allow you to apply binary operators over parameter packs in a concise and readable way.
- **nested_namespaces:** Allow you to define multiple namespaces in a single line using the :: syntax.
- **ctad:** Template argument deduction for class templates (CTAD) allows the compiler to deduce the template parameters of a class from its constructor arguments.
- **auto_for_braced-init-list:** `auto` can now deduce the type of a braced-init-list more accurately, avoiding ambiguities and ensuring better type deduction.
- **exception_specifications:** Exception specifications (like noexcept) are now part of a function's type, meaning they affect overloading, type deduction, and other type-related behavior.
- **no_discard_fallthrough_maybe_unused:** Provide additional information about functions, return values, and variables, helping compilers and developers improve code quality.
- **`variant`:** Provides a type-safe union for handling different types of values in C++17.
- **`optional`:** Represents optional values that may or may not contain a value.
- **`any`:** Allows you to store any type of value while maintaining type safety at runtime.
- **`string_view`:** Provides a non-owning, read-only view into a string or a part of a string. It is designed to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary string copies.
- **`filesystem`:** Allows you to store any type of value while maintaining type safety at runtime.
- **`byte`:** Represents a single byte as a distinct type, providing better type safety than char or unsigned char for byte-oriented operations.
- **Parallel Algorithms:** Allows certain algorithms to be executed in parallel, potentially improving performance on multi-core processors.
- **`invoke`:** Used to call a callable object (such as a function, member function, or a functor) with arbitrary arguments.
- **`apply`:** Allows you to apply a callable (such as a function, lambda, or function object) to the elements of a tuple. It "unpacks" the tuple elements and passes them as arguments to the callable.
- **splicing:** Allows you to efficiently transfer elements between two containers without needing to copy or move the elements explicitly.
