### C++14

- **return_type_deduction:** Automatically deduce their return type based on the return statement, simplifying code and enhancing flexibility.
- **decltype(auto):** Allows for flexible type deduction, preserving references and cv-qualifiers when deducing the return type.
- **relaxed_constexpr_restrictions:** Allow more functions and expressions to be evaluated at compile-time.
- **variable_templates:** Allow the creation of templated variables, enabling specialization for different types.
- **aggregate_member_initialization:** Allows direct initialization of aggregate members within an initializer list.
- **binary_literal:** 0b prefix to represent binary numbers directly in code.
- **digit_separator:** Using single quotes (') to enhance the readability of large numeric literals.
- **generic_lambdas:** Allowing the use of auto for lambda parameter types, enabling type deduction within lambdas.
- **lambda_caputure_initializers:** Allowing you to initialize captured variables directly within the lambda expression.
- **deprecated_attribute:** Mark functions, classes, or other entities as deprecated, warning users when they are used.
